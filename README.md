# week6
## This website is a Weather Dashboard designed to allow you to search for cities and see what the current and future weather forecast will look like. This website incorporates the OpenWeather API to pull 5 day forecasts with an API key in JavaScript.

### This website is composed of HTML, Bootstrap CSS, and JavaScript
Small note: The UV index works locally in the live server but not in the deployed page. Tried to remedy it by updating links to be HTTPS format and redeploying page but the site is still using the old HTTP links in the script.js file. Im hoping it will update to reflect the correct URLS.
